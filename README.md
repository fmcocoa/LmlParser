# LML Parser

## Description

The AWS API Gateway does some black magic to perfectly mess up our JSON data.
That's why we need this parse_valuer to save the world.

It parse a source string to a Python dictionary. Format of the source
string is defined below.

* The source string begins with a '{', leading white spaces are allowed.
* Each '{' has an enclosing '}', otherwise the source string is malformed.
* Two data types are allowed:
    * Strings are specified by a sequence of raw characters.
    * Objects are specified by a pair of '{' and '}'.
* Elements of an object is specified by this format: `key=value`.
* Elements of an object is split by ',', a trailing ',' after the last element is allowed: `{key1=value1, key2=value2,}`.

For example, this is a valid source string:

```
{
    product1={
        id=gold1,
        price=13,
        items={
            items1=sword,
            items2=axe
        }
    },
    product2={
        id=gold2,
        price=26
    }
}
```
## Usage

```python
source = "THE-SOURCE-STRING"
output = LmlParser(source).parse()

print output
```
